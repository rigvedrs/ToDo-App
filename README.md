# ToDo-App


This is a simple ToDo App that runs on the Django backend and react in the frontend.
I have added some beautiful CSS features and templates such as the hover effect on the "ToDo App" text, different fonts, a beautiful background, etc. 
The task box automatically adjusts it's size based on the amount of text inside it, to prevent overflow. A new modal box pops up when adding or editing a task, and a confirm box appears on attempting to delete a task.
